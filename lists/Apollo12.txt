BEGINNING GET=30H 42M 44S.

1ST MCC.  ABOUT T-10 MIN TO THE BURN.  BEGINNING FUEL=100%.

DATA FOR THE MCC HAS ALREADY BEEN ENTERED. GUIDANCE CHANGED FROM OFF AXIS TO REALTIME.  OFFSETS CHANGED AS FOLLOWS: LONG=-2, LAT=13.2, RAD=11.34M. SET TEJ GET=30H 52M 44S.  TEJ SET TO 30H 52M 44S.

HISTORIC:  IGNITION @ 30H 52M 44.36S, CUT OFF @ 30H 52M 53.55S, DURATION=9.19 SEC.

ENGAGE AUTO BURN.  RECOMMEND DOING BURN IN REAL TIME (NO TIME ACCELERATION) AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO PERFORM THE BURN USING INTERIOR VIEW.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=30H 57M 0S.

MCC IGNITION @ 30H 52M 44S, CUT OFF @30H 52M 59S, DURATION=15S.  FUEL=98.4%.

TURN OFF PLAN ON RIGHT MFD(MAP). TURN ON SOI. CENTER ON SELF AND ZOOM OUT IN ORDER TO SEE BOTH EARTH'S AND LUNAR SOI.

USING TIME ACCELERATION, COAST OUT TO JUST OUTSIDE EARTH'S SOI - RECOMMEND NOT TO EXCEED 1000X.

CHANGE BACK TO REAL TIME AND BRING UP PLANET APPROACH ON LEFT MFD.  CHANGE REF=MOON.  SET EQI EQUAL TO THE SAME VALUE DISPLAYED ON RIGHT MFD - SHOULD BE ABOUT 159.59 DEG.  SET PEA=114.2K.

AGAIN, USING TIME ACCELERATION, COAST UNTIL JUST INSIDE OF MOON'S SOI, ABOUT GET=77H 41M.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=77H 43M 0S.

COAST UNTIL MAP PET < 20K. SWITCH TO REAL TIME.

BRING UP ORBIT INSERT ON LEFT MFD. CHANGE ECCENTRICITY TO APOAPIS. SET APA=315.2K.
ENGAGE AUTO BURN.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=78H 0M 50S.

SAME AS STEP 10, EXCEPT ORBIT INSERT DATA SET UP.  DON'T FORGET TO ENGAGE AUTO BURN.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=83H 33M 1S.

LOI IGNITION WAS AT GET=83H 25M 35S (11.64S LATE). LOI CUTOFF WAS AT GET=83H 31M 13S (0.61S EARLY).  ECC=1 @ 83H 27M 8S.  FUEL @ 40.8.  FINAL ORBIT IS 315.3KM X 107.1KM VS. HISTORIC 315.2KM X 114.2KM.  T=7.722K.

JUST STARTED ORBIT 1. COAST THROUGH THIS AND #2 TO ABOUT GET=87H 44M - JUST BEFORE THE START OF ORBIT 3.  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED NOT TO EXCEED 100X TIME ACCELERATION.  ORBIT MFD SHOULD ALREADY BE ACTIVE ON THE LEFT - BRING UP BURNTIMECALCULATOR MFD (BTC MFD) ON THE RIGHT.  TURN THE RETROGRADE AUTOPILOT ON.

WE ARE GOING TO PERFORM THE CIRCULARIZATION BURN USING BTC AND MANUAL ACTIONS.  SET UP BTC FOR A CIRC BURN AT PERIAPSE - AUTOCIRC ARMED SHOULD INDICATE 14.637S.  AFTER THE BURN STARTS, WATCH APA ON ORBIT MFD - WHEN IT GETS CLOSE TO 124KM, CHANGE TIME ACCELERATION TO 0.1X.  MANUALLY KILL THE BTC BURN USING THE "*" KEY, GETTING AS CLOSE TO 122.4KM AS POSSIBLE.  YOU MAY NEED TO MAKE A SMALL ADJUSTMENT USING LINEAR RCS TO MAKE APA=122.4KM.

AT THIS POINT, FUEL=38.5%, AND T SHOULD EQUAL 7.156K (ON ORBIT MFD). MAINTAINING A RETROGRADE ATTITUDE, COAST TO THE START OF ORBIT 4 (AT PERIAPSE AGAIN).  MANUALLY BURN THE SPS TO REDUCE T, SO T=7.128K.  FUEL LEVEL AROUND 38.3%.

COAST TO THE START OF ORBIT 13, ABOUT GET=107H 35M.  SWITCH TO THE LM AND ACTIVATE.  SWITCH BACK TO THE CSM AND ORIENT THE STACK SO THE LM IS BETWEEN THE MOON AND THE CSM.  UNDOCK @ HISTORIC GET=107M 54M 02S.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=107H 54M 7S.

JUST AFTER STACK UNDOCKING.

SWITCH FOCUS TO LM.  ENGAGE DOI AUTOPILOT, P17.  DOI IGNITION @ 109H 23M 0S (39.9S EARLY).  DOI CUT OFF @ 109H 24M 13S (4.1S LATE).  FUEL NOW AT 98.7%.

SWITCH FOCUS TO CSM.  ENGAGE PROGRADE.  AT PERIAPSIS, BURN LINEAR RCS TO REDUCE T BY 3 SECONDS, MAKING T=7.125K.  SWITCH FOCUS BACK TO THE LM.

CHECK PDI CONDITIONS - YOU SHOULD BE GO.  ORIENT THE LM SO THAT IT IS FACE UP AND ENGINE BELL FORWARD.  IT IS RECOMMENDED TO ENGAGE PDI AUTOPILOT, P63, AT GET=110H 17M 36S.  ENJOY THE RIDE.

PDI IGNITION @ 110H 20M 35S (3.1S EARLY).  TOUCHDOWN @  110H 32M 42S (6.9S LATE)

----------------

BEGINNING GET=110H 32M 42S.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=131H 2M 0S.

ABOUT T-30M TO EVA2.  EGRESS STARTED AT GET=131H 32M 45S.

THERE ARE 3 CAMERA PRESETS FOR PETE CONRAD'S 12, 4, AND 8 O'CLOCK PANS.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=139H 45M 0S.

ENGAGE LIFTOFF PREPARATION ("J" KEY").  SWITCH FOCUS TO CSM, AND ENGAGE ORBIT/BASE ALIGNMENT AT ABOUT GET=141H 25M.

AFTER THE ALIGNMENT BURN, YOU SHOULD BE 107.2KM X 112.3KM ORBIT, WITH T=7.127K, WITH 32.4% FUEL REMAINING.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=141H 40M 0S.

CHANGE TO BV VIEW AND NOTE TOTAL UNDER DV REMAINING. WE WANT TO BURN ALL BUT 100 M/S DV. GET CLOSE TO 100 M/S REMAINING - SWITCH TO 0.1X - CLICK ON AB TO STOP THE BURN EARLY.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=201H 55M 0S.

SET RIGHT MFD TO MAP: AZO=OFF, DSP=ON, SOI=ON. CENTER ON SELF.

ON LEFT MFD, SET SRC TO SELF.  CHANGE "APPROACH FOR:" TO RE-ENTRY(OLD).  SET TEJ=202:00:00.  SET FLIGHT TIME=152539S.  CHECK THAT UNDER THE LEFT HAND COLUMN (UNDER TARGET), GET SHOULD EQUAL 244:22:19.

ENGAGE AUTO BURN.  ONCE BURN IS COMPLETE, TURN ON PLAN ON THE RIGHT MFD.  COAST TO A GET OF ABOUT 219H 2M, RECOMMENDED NOT TO EXCEED 100X TIME ACCELERATION.

NOTE: THIS MCC BURN ISN'T AT THE HISTORIC TIME OF 188H 27M 16S.
