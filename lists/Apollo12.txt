----------------

BEGINNING GET=78H 0M 50S.

SAME AS STEP 10, EXCEPT ORBIT INSERT DATA SET UP.  DON'T FORGET TO ENGAGE AUTO BURN.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=83H 33M 1S.

LOI IGNITION WAS AT GET=83H 25M 35S (11.64S LATE). LOI CUTOFF WAS AT GET=83H 31M 13S (0.61S EARLY).  ECC=1 @ 83H 27M 8S.  FUEL @ 40.8.  FINAL ORBIT IS 315.3KM X 107.1KM VS. HISTORIC 315.2KM X 114.2KM.  T=7.722K.

JUST STARTED ORBIT 1. COAST THROUGH THIS AND #2 TO ABOUT GET=87H 44M - JUST BEFORE THE START OF ORBIT 3.  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED NOT TO EXCEED 100X TIME ACCELERATION.  ORBIT MFD SHOULD ALREADY BE ACTIVE ON THE LEFT - BRING UP BURNTIMECALCULATOR MFD (BTC MFD) ON THE RIGHT.  TURN THE RETROGRADE AUTOPILOT ON.

WE ARE GOING TO PERFORM THE CIRCULARIZATION BURN USING BTC AND MANUAL ACTIONS.  SET UP BTC FOR A CIRC BURN AT PERIAPSE - AUTOCIRC ARMED SHOULD INDICATE 14.637S.  AFTER THE BURN STARTS, WATCH APA ON ORBIT MFD - WHEN IT GETS CLOSE TO 124KM, CHANGE TIME ACCELERATION TO 0.1X.  MANUALLY KILL THE BTC BURN USING THE "*" KEY, GETTING AS CLOSE TO 122.4KM AS POSSIBLE.  YOU MAY NEED TO MAKE A SMALL ADJUSTMENT USING LINEAR RCS TO MAKE APA=122.4KM.

AT THIS POINT, FUEL=38.5%, AND T SHOULD EQUAL 7.156K (ON ORBIT MFD). MAINTAINING A RETROGRADE ATTITUDE, COAST TO THE START OF ORBIT 4 (AT PERIAPSE AGAIN).  MANUALLY BURN THE SPS TO REDUCE T, SO T=7.128K.  FUEL LEVEL AROUND 38.3%.

COAST TO THE START OF ORBIT 13, ABOUT GET=107H 35M.  SWITCH TO THE LM AND ACTIVATE.  SWITCH BACK TO THE CSM AND ORIENT THE STACK SO THE LM IS BETWEEN THE MOON AND THE CSM.  UNDOCK @ HISTORIC GET=107M 54M 02S.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=107H 54M 7S.

JUST AFTER STACK UNDOCKING.

SWITCH FOCUS TO LM.  ENGAGE DOI AUTOPILOT, P17.  DOI IGNITION @ 109H 23M 0S (39.9S EARLY).  DOI CUT OFF @ 109H 24M 13S (4.1S LATE).  FUEL NOW AT 98.7%.

SWITCH FOCUS TO CSM.  ENGAGE PROGRADE.  AT PERIAPSIS, BURN LINEAR RCS TO REDUCE T BY 3 SECONDS, MAKING T=7.125K.  SWITCH FOCUS BACK TO THE LM.

CHECK PDI CONDITIONS - YOU SHOULD BE GO.  ORIENT THE LM SO THAT IT IS FACE UP AND ENGINE BELL FORWARD.  IT IS RECOMMENDED TO ENGAGE PDI AUTOPILOT, P63, AT GET=110H 17M 36S.  ENJOY THE RIDE.

PDI IGNITION @ 110H 20M 35S (3.1S EARLY).  TOUCHDOWN @  110H 32M 42S (6.9S LATE)

----------------

BEGINNING GET=110H 32M 42S.

LUNAR TOUCHDOWN AT GET=110H 32M 42S (6.9S LATE).

----------------

BEGINNING GET=114H 40M 0S.

ABOUT T-30M TO EVA1.  EGRESS STARTED AT GET=115H 10M 35S.  THERE IS A CAMERA PRESET TO SIMULATE THE TV CAMERA WHILE IT WAS STILL IN THE MESA(AND WORKING).

----------------

BEGINNING GET=131H 2M 0S.

ABOUT T-30M TO EVA2.  EGRESS STARTED AT GET=131H 32M 45S.

THERE ARE 3 CAMERA PRESETS FOR PETE CONRAD'S 12, 4, AND 8 O'CLOCK PANS.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=139H 45M 0S.

ENGAGE LIFTOFF PREPARATION ("J" KEY").  SWITCH FOCUS TO CSM, AND ENGAGE ORBIT/BASE ALIGNMENT AT ABOUT GET=141H 25M.

AFTER THE ALIGNMENT BURN, YOU SHOULD BE 107.2KM X 112.3KM ORBIT, WITH T=7.127K, WITH 32.4% FUEL REMAINING.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=141H 40M 0S.

ABOUT T-24 MIN.

ENGAGE AUTOPILOT P12.  SAY GOODBYE TO THE SNOWMAN, AND ENJOY THE RIDE.

P12 IGNITION AT 142H 3M 48S (ON TIME). P12 CUTOFF AT 142H 10M 16S (45.78S EARLY).

----------------

BEGINNING GET=145H 11M 8S.

JUST AFTER LM ASCENT DOCKING WITH CSM.  ABOUT 25M 12 S EARLY.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=147H 45M 0S.

ABOUT T-15 MIN TO JETTISON.

ORIENT LM ASCENT STAGE BETWEEN THE CSM AND THE MOON.  SWITCH FOCUS TO LM (INTERIOR VIEW). ACTIVATE LM CREW DEFINITIVE LEAVE ("J" KEY).

SWITCH FOCUS BACK TO THE CSM.  JETTISON ON HISTORIC TIME GET=147H 59M 32S.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=147H 59M 55S.

JUST AFTER FINAL LM UNDOCK/JETTISON.

AFTER WATCHING THE LM "SELF DESTRUCT", ENGAGE RETROGRADE AUTOPILOT, AND COAST TO ABOUT GET=148H 50M.  BURN TO REDUCE T, SO T=7.111K.

ENGAGE PROGRADE AUTOPILOT.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=170H 30M 0S.

SET LEFT MFD TO IMFD, BASE APPROACH. SET REF=EARTH,SRC=MOON. CHANGE EJECT TIME SO GET=172H 27M 13S.

SET RIGHT MFD TO IMFD WITH OP MODE SHARED WITH ID-0. THEN SELECT ORBIT-EJECT. CHANGE HIGHER ORBIT SETTING TO BASE-APPROACH. SET TEJ EQUAL TO TEJ DISPLAYED IN BASE APPROACH. ENGAGE AUTO BURN.

CHANGE TO BV VIEW AND NOTE TOTAL UNDER DV REMAINING. WE WANT TO BURN ALL BUT 100 M/S DV. GET CLOSE TO 100 M/S REMAINING - SWITCH TO 0.1X - CLICK ON AB TO STOP THE BURN EARLY.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=201H 55M 0S.

SET RIGHT MFD TO MAP: AZO=OFF, DSP=ON, SOI=ON. CENTER ON SELF.

ON LEFT MFD, SET SRC TO SELF.  CHANGE "APPROACH FOR:" TO RE-ENTRY(OLD).  SET TEJ=202:00:00.  SET FLIGHT TIME=152539S.  CHECK THAT UNDER THE LEFT HAND COLUMN (UNDER TARGET), GET SHOULD EQUAL 244:22:19.

ENGAGE AUTO BURN.  ONCE BURN IS COMPLETE, TURN ON PLAN ON THE RIGHT MFD.  COAST TO A GET OF ABOUT 219H 2M, RECOMMENDED NOT TO EXCEED 100X TIME ACCELERATION.

NOTE: THIS MCC BURN ISN'T AT THE HISTORIC TIME OF 188H 27M 16S.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=219H 3M 0S.

RIGHT MFD: TURN PLAN ON, AND WAIT FOR PEA TO DECREASE TO A VALUE OF 41.10 KM (THIS HAPPENS AROUND GET OF 220H 29M).

IF YOU USE TIME ACCELERATION, RECOMMENDED NOT TO EXCEED 100X.

RETURN TO REAL TIME, AND ENGAGE AUTO BURN ON LEFT MFD.

ONCE THE BURN IS COMPLETED, TURN PLAN OFF, AND ADJUST PEA AS NEEDED WITH LINEAR RCS, USING THE ORIENTATION FROM THE JUST COMPLETED AUTO BURN.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=243H 52M 0S.

ABOUT T-15 MIN TO SEPARATION FROM THE SERVICE MODULE.

ENGAGE PROGRADE AUTOPILOT.

AT GET=244H 7M 20S (HISTORIC), JETTISON THE SM.  ONCE IT IS CLEAR, ENGAGE THE RETROGRADE AUTOPILOT.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=244H 12M 0S.

AFTER CM/SM SEPARATION.

GET AT PERIAPSIS=244H 26M 9S.  RET=244H 24M 1S.

NOTE: AT T+2M 45S FROM ENTRY (244M 26M 46S), PITCH DOWN TO -10 DEG. HOLD THIS ATTITUDE UNTIL RCS IS UNABLE.  YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET WITHIN 20KM OF THE ACTUAL SPLASHDOWN LOCATION.

----------------

BEGINNING GET=244H 35M 7S.

SPLASHDOWN AT SAME, 1M 18S EARLY. LOCATION: 165.327 DEG W, 15.759 DEG S. 19.07 KM FROM ACTUAL.

HISTORIC NUMBERS:
